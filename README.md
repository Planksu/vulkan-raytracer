# vulkan-raytracer

A raytracer demo made using Vulkan API for a course assignment. This project was mostly a learning process, and I did look at many pre-defined examples made with Vulkan.

Uses compute shaders for calculating rays.

Confirmed working on Windows 10 and Android, though Android does require additional dependencies. Build files to be added later.
